                Please be aware that the time it takes for the refund to appear in your account depends on the payment method:

              <p>
                After the initial 7-day money-back guarantee period has expired, refunds are generally not provided. However, we understand that exceptional circumstances may arise. In such cases, refund requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Exceptional circumstances that may warrant a refund consideration include:

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
                <li>Technical issues that prevent access to Pro features, which our support team has been unable to resolve within a reasonable timeframe</li>

              <p>
                It's important to note that requesting a refund will also result in the cancellation of your Pro plan subscription. Upon refund approval, your account will revert to the free plan, and you will lose access to all Pro features.
